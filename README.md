# My Professional Webpage

Hey there! Welcome to my first independent HTML + CSS project— a simple and professional webpage I designed to introduce myself and showcase some of what I’ve learned so far.

## About This Project

This webpage serves as my personal online portfolio. I built it from scratch using only HTML and CSS to demonstrate my understanding of structure, styling, and responsive design fundamentals.

The goal was to create something minimal yet professional — a space that reflects both my technical progress and who I am as a person.

## Features

- Clean and semantic HTML structure  
- Custom CSS styling  
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- Links to my **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profiles

## About Me

My name is **Colby J. Rhodes**, and I currently work as a **Quality Assurance Analyst at Shipt**, where I’ve been part of the team for over four years.  
I began my coding journey in the summer of 2024 through an edX bootcamp with **The University of Michigan**, completing it in **January 2025**.  

Technology and software engineering have always fascinated me — I love exploring how things work behind the scenes and continuously improving my skills.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- Watching documentaries 
- Researching topics that catch my curiosity 
- Spending time with my family and two cats 
- Or traveling (in 2023, I even took a solo trip to Melbourne, Australia)
