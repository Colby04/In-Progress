    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Colby Rhodes. I'm currently employed at Shipt as a Quality Assurance Analyst. I've been with the company for 4 years.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
    <p> I began my coding journey in the summer of 2024. I started my bootcamp course with edX though The University of Michigan. I completed the course in January 2025. I've always been interested in technologies and the engineering aspects of software development.</p>
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy watching documentaries, researching any new topics that peak my interest, and spending time with my family and 2 cats.</p>
    <p> I also enjoy traveling whenever my schedule allows. In 2023, I traveled solo to Melbourne, Australia for 2 weeks.</p>
